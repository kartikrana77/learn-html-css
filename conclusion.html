        Saitama is an overpowered hero in general. He's not just powerful, but
        is definitively stronger than any other heroes. Let's break down these
        two glaring differences between them and explain why Saitama is stronger
        than Goku. CBR VIDEO OF THE DAY RELATED: Chainsaw Man Homages Two Iconic
        Naruto Scenes What Makes Saitama Stronger Than Goku? Saitama looking
        upward with a goofy smile in One Punch Man Saitama is a B-class hero and
        just a plain old human. He experiences everything an average human does
        and ages with time. Additionally, he has no special abilities like
        regenerative or magical powers. Goku, meanwhile, comes from an alien
        warrior race with superpowers, he can fly, use ki blasts and enhance his
        strength through his Super Saiyan forms. Saiyans age slowly compared to
        humans, as stated by Vegeta in Season 9 of Dragon Ball, which is a huge
        advantage. Despite this massive gap between even their basic genetic
        makeup, Saitama displays as much strength as a regular Saiyan without
        any effort. In the times he has exerted even a bit more than his regular
        power, it's apparent his strength is comparable to Super Saiyan levels.
        The audience can only imagine how powerful Saitama could possibly get if
        he goes beyond his normal and serious punches. RELATED: One-Punch Man:

        Trained Like Goku, He'd Be Unstoppable Goku smirking and holding a
        thumbs up outward Goku trains in martial arts in many different
        environments. He has even gone to other planets to improve his skills
        and endurance. There is even a specific episode where he uses a gravity
        machine to train under 100 times gravity and reached 10,000 situps.
        Since he also enjoys fighting, he regularly spars with his friends and
        children. Not only does he improve his techniques in battle, but also
        his power levels. Saitama, on the other hand, has only mentioned
        sticking to his daily work out of 100 push-ups, situps, squats and a
        10km run. From what has transpired in the anime, it appears like there
        is no need for him to improve or change. If harsher training has
        increased Goku's power, this should also apply to Saitama. He reached
        his current status by only relying on traditional methods. It is
        reasonable to hypothesize that if Saitama trained the exact same way
        Goku did, he would be far more powerful than Goku. RELATED: Dragon Ball

        Man's Growth Potential Gives Him the Advantage Saitama throwing a
        serious punch in One-Punch Man. Though both protagonists are
        powerhouses, it's evident that they have glaring differences from one
        another. One is a brawl-hungry extraterrestrial being, while the other
        is a convenience store part-timer turned hero. The fact they can even be
        compared on equal footing at all shows Saitama has the advantage in this
        battle of power. He exhibits the same strength effortlessly and yet
        still has more room for growth. At this point, he hasn't ever needed to
        use his full power, whereas Goku frequently needs to reach his limits.
        All in all, Saitama wins this competition. Of course, Goku will always
        be one of the greats, but the evidence of his restrictions is clear.
        There's no greater weapon than the infinite possibility for growth, and
        Saitama's potential appears even greater.</big
