        Goku[nb 21] is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the
        Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun
        Wukong (known as Son Goku in Japan and Monkey King in the West), a main
        character of the classic 16th century Chinese novel Journey to the West,
        combined with influences from the Hong Kong martial arts films of Jackie
        Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku made his debut in the first Dragon Ball
        chapter, Bulma and Son Goku,[nb 22][nb 23] originally published in
        Japan's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984.[2] Goku is
        introduced as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts
        and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a
        journey to find the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. Along the way, he
        finds new friends who follow him on his journey to become a stronger
        fighter. As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and
        battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends and
        family, while also gaining new allies in the process. Born as a member
        of the Saiyan race on Planet Vegeta, under the name Kakarot,[nb 24][nb
        25] he is sent to Earth as an infant prior to his homeworld's
        destruction at the hands of Frieza (ordered by Beerus[3]). Upon his
        arrival on Earth, the infant is discovered by Son Gohan, who becomes the
        adoptive grandfather of the boy and gives him the name Goku. The boy is
        initially full of violence and aggression due to his Saiyan nature,
        until an accidental head injury turns him into a cheerful, carefree
        person. Grandpa Gohan's kindness and teachings help to further influence
        Goku, who later on names his first son Gohan in honor of him. As the
        protagonist of Dragon Ball, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films,
        television specials and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations (Dragon
        Ball, Dragon Ball Z) and sequels (Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super), as
        well as many of the franchise's video games. Due to the series'
        international popularity, Goku became one of the most recognizable and
        iconic manga/anime characters worldwide. Outside the Dragon Ball
        franchise, Goku has made cameo appearances in Toriyama's self-parody
        series Neko Majin Z, has been the subject of other parodies, and has
        appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced to
        the adult version of Goku appearing in the Dragon Ball Z anime, itself
        an adaptation of Dragon Ball manga volumes 17–42, as opposed to his
        initial child form, due to the limited success of the first series
        overseas.[4] Goku's critical reception has been largely positive.</big

        <big>
          <li><strong> Physical Abilities:</strong></li>
          Saiyan As a Saiyan, Goku possesses a vast array of superhuman physical
          attributes, which he has trained to God-like levels through years of
          rigorous training.

          <br />
          <br />

          <strong> <li>Superhuman Strength:</li></strong>

          As a Saiyan, Goku possesses immense physical strength, far more
          advanced than that of any human being, and most alien races. He is
          strong enough to effortlessly break all Earthling-made materials or
          weapons, move in increased gravity without any discomfort, and even
          lift a suit capable of sinking through a planet. His physical strength
          is great enough that he can harm notably durable opponents.

          <br />
          <br />

          <strong> <li>Superhuman Speed:</li></strong>

          Goku can move/react to fast paced fighters, including characters said
          to be as fast or faster than light, and cross vast distances in a
          short time span. It's also said that he moves faster than can be seen.

          <br />
          <br />

          <strong> <li>Durability:</li></strong>

          Goku's body is far more durable than that of normal human beings,
          being essentially invulnerable to all Earthling-made weapons. He can
          survive attacks that would dramatically harm other fighters. However,
          while naturally durable thanks to his Saiyan physiology and training,
          he does have limits, as other powerful beings as himself can hurt, and
          potentially kill him, if he does not defend himself correctly, and
          when purposely lowering his guard and ki to protect him, even an
          ordinary energy gun shot, was capable of leaving him near death.

          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong> Superhuman Senses:</strong></li>

          Goku is able to think and react at extremely high speeds, easily able
          to dodge or catch projectiles fired from weapons, or even keep up with
          incredible combat speeds from his opponents. As a Saiyan, Goku also
          has enhanced senses of smell, taste and sight, which further increase
          his combat senses and instincts. Superhuman Endurance: Thanks to his
          physiology and willpower, Goku is capable of exerting himself even if
          fatigued from using techniques or transformations that cost a lot of
          his energy or wounded. This was shown when he defeated Piccolo when he
          was younger despite his limbs being broken and was mortally wounded.

          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong>Powerful Lungs :</strong></li>

          Thanks to his physiology, Goku possesses powerful lungs, being even
          able to breathe in the stratosphere while fighting Beerus.[1][2]

          <br />
          <br />
          <li><strong> Heat Resistance:</strong></li>

          Thanks to his Saiyan biology, Goku possesses an extremely high
          resistance to heat. This was first seen when he was able to calmly
          relax in the boiling hot saunas of Princess Snake's palace. As the
          years went by, his resistance to heat only increased, as he was able
          to fall through the Earth's atmosphere without burning up from the
          high-speed descent, or when he fought Broly in the high temperatures
          of lava. However, this could be because Goku's energy acts as a
          barrier against the lava, and not because his body is naturally
          resistant to such high temperatures.

          Goku has a great mastery over his Ki; the natural life force every
          being possess and uses it to increase his fighting abilities.
          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong> Flight – </strong></li>
          The ability to take flight through the manipulation of ki. However, as
          a Saiyan, Goku already possesses the innate ability to fly, which
          later in adulthood, he has shown to completely dominate. In Dragon
          Ball Fusions, Kid Goku from the time he was training under Kami
          manages to somehow learn how to fly using ki and demonstrates the same
          proficiency at flying that his future adult self does.
          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong> Ki Sense – </strong></li>
          The ability to sense the energy of other beings. Goku acquired the
          ability after drinking the Ultra Divine Water but was unable to use it
          to home in on an opponent's location until he trained with Mr. Popo.
          He can also hide his ki to prevent someone else senses his.
          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong> Ki Transfer – </strong></li>
          Goku can grant some of his energy to another fighter to restore some
          of their energy. Spirit Control - Thanks to his training on Yardrat,
          Goku gained the basic level of Spirit Control, allowing him to sense
          ki at a much greater distance and use Instant Transmission.
          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong> Godly Ki mastery – </strong></li>
          Goku can change the nature of his ki to that of the gods, increasing
          his power drastically. With the Godly Ki, Goku gains access to
          god-level transformations such as the Super Saiyan God and Super
          Saiyan Blue. Regeneration - Super Saiyan God Goku is able to
          regenerate by pouring his godly ki into his wounds.
          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong> Energy Nullification –</strong></li>
          During his battle with Beerus, Goku learned how to nullify the
          negative damaging effects of their clash.</big

          <li><strong> Genius of Combat – </strong></li>
          Goku is able to prepare complex strategies when it comes to fighting.
          On more than one occasion, he was able to defeat opponents he was no
          match at first against by using the clever tactics. In addition, Goku
          has said that techniques used against him cannot work more than once,
          because he can adapt to them and find their weak points. Mimicry: Goku
          is capable of instantly learning techniques performed by other
          fighters after seeing them only once. He most famously learned Master
          Roshi's Kamehameha (who took him 50 years to develop), as well as
          other techniques such as the Drunken Fist and Afterimage Technique. He
          later learned to perform King Chappa's Eight-Arm Fist, and (in the
          Dragon Ball Super manga) was even able to use a lesser version of
          Beerus' Hakai. Gokumindread Goku mind reads
          <br />
          <br />
          <li><strong> Telepathy – </strong></li>
          A way to communicate with others using one's mind. Users can also read
          the minds of the ones they communicate with, similar to telepathic
          eavesdropping. During his time with King Kai, Goku learned this
          ability and taught himself how to read the minds of others, by placing
          his palm on their head.
          <br />
          <br />
          <li><strong> Autonomous Ultra Instinct – </strong></li>
          A highly advanced mental state. Goku gradually learned this from
          training under Whis. During the Tournament of Power, Goku unlocked a
          special state and perfected it, enabling him to put Whis' teachings to
          use. Using Ultra instinct, Goku's physical and mental parameters are
          vastly augmented, providing him with not only equally increased combat
          performance, but also giving him access to the Ultra Instinct ability,
          allowing him to instinctively dodge and attack any nearby threat in
          the most effective way possible. Despite the usefulness of this
          ability, Goku could initially only access it as a subconscious
          reaction to the direst of situations. After training with Merus, and
          during the battle with Moro, he was able to consciously access it and
          utilize the incomplete and completed forms at will. Further training
          with Whis has resulted in Goku even being able to access Ultra
          Instinct outside of the transformations, though his control of it
          outside of the forms is incomplete. He can also combine this usage
          with his Super Saiyan forms, which allows him to increase his
          precision with it.

          Goku experiences his Super Saiyan transformation. Unlike his fight
          against Vegeta, where he allows Kaioken to destroy his body, Goku bows
          out before the fight with Frieza gives him the chance. He instead puts
          all his energy into a Genki Dama, but that only serves to anger
          Frieza. Frieza retaliates by killing Krillin; however, this ends up
          being his downfall. After watching his best friend burst to shreds
          right before his eyes, Goku transforms into the legendary Super
          Saiyan, gains a second wind, and forces Frieza into one of the most
          humiliating defeats in the series. Super Saiyan remains the most
          iconic of Goku transformations due to its epic debut.

          Goku showcasing his Super Saiyan 2 transformation in Dragon Ball Z The
          Cell arc places a heavy focus on the Super Saiyan state and how to
          push it further. Vegeta, Trunks, and Goku all have their own
          augmentations (called Grade forms), but they’re ostensibly variations
          of the regular Super Saiyan. It isn’t until Gohan triggers Super
          Saiyan 2 during the Cell Games that a new proper form is introduced.
          Following Goku’s death during the Cell Games, he triggers Super Saiyan
          2 while training in the afterlife. It’s likely Goku taps into Super
          Saiyan 2 sooner rather than later (evidenced by a lack of stamina
          drain). Goku first shows off the form in a flash instance against
          Yakon. 9

          Goku fights Kid Buu while utilizing his Super Saiyan 3 form in Dragon
          Ball Z It’s interesting how Toriyama introduces Super Saiyan 2 for
          Goku, only to do away with it shortly after. Goku fights Majin Vegeta
          in the form, but he never fights in it again (in the original manga,
          at least). Triggering Super Saiyan 3 for the first time while stalling
          against Buu, Goku's transformation shakes the actual cosmos. RELATED:

          into account the incredibly heavy toll Super Saiyan 3 puts on a living
          body — and how much effort Goku puts into transforming while dead —
          it's no wonder the form takes Goku significant time to master. He’s
          since gotten a firm hold of Super Saiyan 3 in Dragon Ball Super, but
          its depiction in the Buu arc proves too unwieldy for Goku.

          Super Saiyan 4 Goku standing in front of Planet Earth in the Dragon
          Ball GT Opening The Super Saiyan 4 transformation gained immense
          popularity when it debuted in Dragon Ball GT. While this Goku form,
          and the series it debuted in, were eventually made non-canon, it still
          made frequent appearances in video games and merchandise. After being
          defeated by Baby as a Super Saiyan 3, Goku pursued a greater power.
          Goku obtained Super Saiyan 4 by first regaining his Saiyan tail with
          help from Old Kai, Sugoro, and Shusugoro. This allowed Goku to
          transform into a Golden Oozaru. Goku initially had little control over
          this form. When Pan got through to him, Goku gained control of his
          Golden Oozaru form. In doing so, Goku completed his ascent to Super
          Saiyan 4, which included a grown-up body.

          Super Saiyan God Goku Dodge from Dragon Ball FighterZ prepares to
          strike. At its core, Battle of Gods is a character study of Son Goku
          and the themes that define Dragon Ball. The story centers itself on an
          unbeatable foe, forcing Goku past his limits but without giving him
          the actual satisfaction of doing so. Battle of Gods humbles Goku,
          especially through the act of the Super Saiyan God ritual. Super
          Saiyan God isn't a form Goku earns on his own accord — he receives it
          through the power of others. It’s not something he wants, but he
          understands it’s needed. At the same time, Beerus recognizes Goku’s
          skill remains his own even if his power isn’t. There’s a lot to
          analyze about Goku’s characterization in BoG.

          Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken Goku punches hit in Dragon Ball Super After
          Golden Frieza's defeat, both Goku and Vegeta sought to improve upon
          their newfound Super Saiyan Blue abilities. Vegeta accomplished this
          later on in Dragon Ball Super, but Goku quickly found a new avenue
          through the use of an old technique. Thanks to having greater ki
          control through Super Saiyan Blue, Goku could incorporate the Kaioken
          technique. Goku initially planned to save this form for a rematch
          against Beerus, but felt needed to use its ability multipliers to get
          past Hit's time-skip technique. Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken had the same
          drawbacks as the base Kaioken, as Goku's body couldn't handle it
          indefinitely.

          Ultra Instinct Goku versus Jiren in Dragon Ball Super The Universe
          Survival arc became a major turning point for Dragon Ball Super and
          basically re-contextualized modern Dragon Ball. All the pieces had
          been rearranged, the multiverse has been properly expanded, and Goku
          had a new end goal in mind: mastering Ultra Instinct. Goku triggered
          Ultra Instinct for the first time during the Tournament of Power. In
          the anime, Ultra Instinct was fueled by his own Genki Dama’s energy,
          whereas the manga had Goku tapping into Ultra Instinct as a mental
          state. Ultra Instinct was treated like a technique through the series’
          actual text, but it’s depicted as a transformation. As of the Moro
          arc, Goku could trigger Ultra Instinct -Sign- at will so long as his
          mind was calm.

          Completed Mastered Ultra Instinct Goku in Dragon Ball Super. Ultra
          Instinct -Sign- wasn't enough to surpass Jiren in the Tournament of
          Power — Goku needed to dig deeper by completing his Ultra Instinct
          form. Pushed to the brink of elimination in his Ultra Instinct -Sign-
          form, Goku remained on the defensive during an onslaught of Jiren
          punches. After a while, Goku pushed back. This surge in offense
          culminated in Goku reaching the Perfected Ultra Instinct. It wasn't
          until training with Merus during the Moro arc that he reached Ultra
          Instinct -Sign- again. Goku later triggered the completed Ultra
          Instinct after Merus' erasure, when Goku kept his emotions in check
          during a heartbreaking moment. Since then, Goku has used the form at
          will.

          Goku's Divine Ki Giant Battle Avatar as seen in Dragon Ball Super
          During the Galactic Patrol Prisoner arc, Goku is pushed to his
          absolute limits against Planet-Eater Moro. In order to stop the
          warlock from detonating and destroying the galaxy, Goku attempts to
          destroy the villain's forehead crystal, only to be captured and
          drained of energy by his opponent. However, thanks to the divine
          energy of Uub and Goku's other allies, the series' protagonist could
          recharge and reach a new form: Divine Ki Giant Battle Avatar. RELATED:

          which is visually similar to the Susanoo seen in the Narutofranchise —
          is a physical manifestation of Goku's Divine ki. So far, the
          transformation has only occurred while Goku was in dire circumstances
          against Moro and Gas, the primary antagonists of the manga's latest
          arcs.

          True Ultra Instinct Goku kicking Gas in the Dragon Ball Super Manga
          For Goku to utilize Perfected Ultra Instinct, his emotions must be
          completely calm. While this transformation increases his power
          immensely, it doesn't lean into Goku's natural disposition. The Saiyan
          warrior is driven by passion, ambition, and rage when he fights, and
          as a result, Perfect Ultra Instinct isn't maximizing his talents.
          However, True Ultra Instinct, which Goku achieves by combining Ultra
          Instinct -Sign- with his Saiyan emotions, perfectly suits his
          battle-driven nature. Goku and Vegeta struggled to defend themselves
          against Gas during the Granolah the Survivor arc until the former
          debuted this form. Using its newfound power, he gained the upper hand
          against Gas, even after the villain survived Granolah's ultimate
          attack. Were it not for the intervention of Black Frieza, True Ultra
          Instinct would easily be the strongest form to appear in the
          franchise.
