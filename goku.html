     <big> Goku[nb 21] is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the
      Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun
      Wukong (known as Son Goku in Japan and Monkey King in the West), a main
      character of the classic 16th century Chinese novel Journey to the West,
      combined with influences from the Hong Kong martial arts films of Jackie
      Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku made his debut in the first Dragon Ball chapter,
      Bulma and Son Goku,[nb 22][nb 23] originally published in Japan's Weekly
      Shōnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984.[2] Goku is introduced as an
      eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses
      superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the
      seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. Along the way, he finds new friends who
      follow him on his journey to become a stronger fighter. As Goku grows up,
      he becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of
      villains with the help of his friends and family, while also gaining new
      allies in the process. Born as a member of the Saiyan race on Planet
      Vegeta, under the name Kakarot,[nb 24][nb 25] he is sent to Earth as an
      infant prior to his homeworld's destruction at the hands of Frieza
      (ordered by Beerus[3]). Upon his arrival on Earth, the infant is
      discovered by Son Gohan, who becomes the adoptive grandfather of the boy
      and gives him the name Goku. The boy is initially full of violence and
      aggression due to his Saiyan nature, until an accidental head injury turns
      him into a cheerful, carefree person. Grandpa Gohan's kindness and
      teachings help to further influence Goku, who later on names his first son
      Gohan in honor of him. As the protagonist of Dragon Ball, Goku appears in
      most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of the manga's
      anime adaptations (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z) and sequels (Dragon Ball
      GT, Dragon Ball Super), as well as many of the franchise's video games.
      Due to the series' international popularity, Goku became one of the most
      recognizable and iconic manga/anime characters worldwide. Outside the
      Dragon Ball franchise, Goku has made cameo appearances in Toriyama's
      self-parody series Neko Majin Z, has been the subject of other parodies,
      and has appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced
      to the adult version of Goku appearing in the Dragon Ball Z anime, itself
      an adaptation of Dragon Ball manga volumes 17–42, as opposed to his
      initial child form, due to the limited success of the first series
      overseas.[4] Goku's critical reception has been largely positive.</big>

    <h2>
      <big>
        <strong><mark>Physical Powers</mark></strong></big
      >
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <big>
        <li><strong> Physical Abilities:</strong></li>
        Saiyan As a Saiyan, Goku possesses a vast array of superhuman physical
        attributes, which he has trained to God-like levels through years of
        rigorous training.

        <br />
        <br />

        <strong> <li>Superhuman Strength:</li></strong>

        As a Saiyan, Goku possesses immense physical strength, far more advanced
        than that of any human being, and most alien races. He is strong enough
        to effortlessly break all Earthling-made materials or weapons, move in
        increased gravity without any discomfort, and even lift a suit capable
        of sinking through a planet. His physical strength is great enough that
        he can harm notably durable opponents.

        <br />
        <br />

        <strong> <li>Superhuman Speed:</li></strong>

        Goku can move/react to fast paced fighters, including characters said to
        be as fast or faster than light, and cross vast distances in a short
        time span. It's also said that he moves faster than can be seen.

        <br />
        <br />

        <strong> <li>Durability:</li></strong>

        Goku's body is far more durable than that of normal human beings, being
        essentially invulnerable to all Earthling-made weapons. He can survive
        attacks that would dramatically harm other fighters. However, while
        naturally durable thanks to his Saiyan physiology and training, he does
        have limits, as other powerful beings as himself can hurt, and
        potentially kill him, if he does not defend himself correctly, and when
        purposely lowering his guard and ki to protect him, even an ordinary
        energy gun shot, was capable of leaving him near death.

        <br />
        <br />

        <li><strong> Superhuman Senses:</strong></li>

        Goku is able to think and react at extremely high speeds, easily able to
        dodge or catch projectiles fired from weapons, or even keep up with
        incredible combat speeds from his opponents. As a Saiyan, Goku also has
        enhanced senses of smell, taste and sight, which further increase his
        combat senses and instincts. Superhuman Endurance: Thanks to his
        physiology and willpower, Goku is capable of exerting himself even if
        fatigued from using techniques or transformations that cost a lot of his
        energy or wounded. This was shown when he defeated Piccolo when he was
        younger despite his limbs being broken and was mortally wounded.

        <br />
        <br />

        <li><strong>Powerful Lungs :</strong></li>

        Thanks to his physiology, Goku possesses powerful lungs, being even able
        to breathe in the stratosphere while fighting Beerus.[1][2]

        <br />
        <br />
        <li><strong> Heat Resistance:</strong></li>

        Thanks to his Saiyan biology, Goku possesses an extremely high
        resistance to heat. This was first seen when he was able to calmly relax
        in the boiling hot saunas of Princess Snake's palace. As the years went
        by, his resistance to heat only increased, as he was able to fall
        through the Earth's atmosphere without burning up from the high-speed
        descent, or when he fought Broly in the high temperatures of lava.
        However, this could be because Goku's energy acts as a barrier against
        the lava, and not because his body is naturally resistant to such high
        temperatures.

            Goku has a great mastery over his Ki; the natural life force every
            being possess and uses it to increase his fighting abilities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong> Flight – </strong></li>
          The ability to take flight through the manipulation of ki. However, as
          a Saiyan, Goku already possesses the innate ability to fly, which
          later in adulthood, he has shown to completely dominate. In Dragon
          Ball Fusions, Kid Goku from the time he was training under Kami
          manages to somehow learn how to fly using ki and demonstrates the same
          proficiency at flying that his future adult self does.
          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong> Ki Sense – </strong></li>
          The ability to sense the energy of other beings. Goku acquired the
          ability after drinking the Ultra Divine Water but was unable to use it
          to home in on an opponent's location until he trained with Mr. Popo.
          He can also hide his ki to prevent someone else senses his.
          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong> Ki Transfer – </strong></li>
          Goku can grant some of his energy to another fighter to restore some
          of their energy. Spirit Control - Thanks to his training on Yardrat,
          Goku gained the basic level of Spirit Control, allowing him to sense
          ki at a much greater distance and use Instant Transmission.
          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong> Godly Ki mastery – </strong></li>
          Goku can change the nature of his ki to that of the gods, increasing
          his power drastically. With the Godly Ki, Goku gains access to
          god-level transformations such as the Super Saiyan God and Super
          Saiyan Blue. Regeneration - Super Saiyan God Goku is able to
          regenerate by pouring his godly ki into his wounds.
          <br />
          <br />

          <li><strong> Energy Nullification –</strong></li>
          During his battle with Beerus, Goku learned how to nullify the
          negative damaging effects of their clash.</big

        <li><strong> Genius of Combat – </strong></li>
        Goku is able to prepare complex strategies when it comes to fighting. On
        more than one occasion, he was able to defeat opponents he was no match
        at first against by using the clever tactics. In addition, Goku has said
        that techniques used against him cannot work more than once, because he
        can adapt to them and find their weak points. Mimicry: Goku is capable
        of instantly learning techniques performed by other fighters after
        seeing them only once. He most famously learned Master Roshi's
        Kamehameha (who took him 50 years to develop), as well as other
        techniques such as the Drunken Fist and Afterimage Technique. He later
        learned to perform King Chappa's Eight-Arm Fist, and (in the Dragon Ball
        Super manga) was even able to use a lesser version of Beerus' Hakai.
        Gokumindread Goku mind reads
        <br />
        <br />
        <li><strong> Telepathy – </strong></li>
        A way to communicate with others using one's mind. Users can also read
        the minds of the ones they communicate with, similar to telepathic
        eavesdropping. During his time with King Kai, Goku learned this ability
        and taught himself how to read the minds of others, by placing his palm
        on their head.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li><strong> Autonomous Ultra Instinct – </strong></li>
        A highly advanced mental state. Goku gradually learned this from
        training under Whis. During the Tournament of Power, Goku unlocked a
        special state and perfected it, enabling him to put Whis' teachings to
        use. Using Ultra instinct, Goku's physical and mental parameters are
        vastly augmented, providing him with not only equally increased combat
        performance, but also giving him access to the Ultra Instinct ability,
        allowing him to instinctively dodge and attack any nearby threat in the
        most effective way possible. Despite the usefulness of this ability,
        Goku could initially only access it as a subconscious reaction to the
        direst of situations. After training with Merus, and during the battle
        with Moro, he was able to consciously access it and utilize the
        incomplete and completed forms at will. Further training with Whis has
        resulted in Goku even being able to access Ultra Instinct outside of the
        transformations, though his control of it outside of the forms is
        incomplete. He can also combine this usage with his Super Saiyan forms,
        which allows him to increase his precision with it.

        Goku experiences his Super Saiyan transformation. Unlike his fight
        against Vegeta, where he allows Kaioken to destroy his body, Goku bows
        out before the fight with Frieza gives him the chance. He instead puts
        all his energy into a Genki Dama, but that only serves to anger Frieza.
        Frieza retaliates by killing Krillin; however, this ends up being his
        downfall. After watching his best friend burst to shreds right before
        his eyes, Goku transforms into the legendary Super Saiyan, gains a
        second wind, and forces Frieza into one of the most humiliating defeats
        in the series. Super Saiyan remains the most iconic of Goku
        transformations due to its epic debut.

        Goku showcasing his Super Saiyan 2 transformation in Dragon Ball Z The
        Cell arc places a heavy focus on the Super Saiyan state and how to push
        it further. Vegeta, Trunks, and Goku all have their own augmentations
        (called Grade forms), but they’re ostensibly variations of the regular
        Super Saiyan. It isn’t until Gohan triggers Super Saiyan 2 during the
        Cell Games that a new proper form is introduced. Following Goku’s death
        during the Cell Games, he triggers Super Saiyan 2 while training in the
        afterlife. It’s likely Goku taps into Super Saiyan 2 sooner rather than
        later (evidenced by a lack of stamina drain). Goku first shows off the
        form in a flash instance against Yakon. 9

        Goku fights Kid Buu while utilizing his Super Saiyan 3 form in Dragon
        Ball Z It’s interesting how Toriyama introduces Super Saiyan 2 for Goku,
        only to do away with it shortly after. Goku fights Majin Vegeta in the
        form, but he never fights in it again (in the original manga, at least).
        Triggering Super Saiyan 3 for the first time while stalling against Buu,
        Goku's transformation shakes the actual cosmos. RELATED: 10 Dragon Ball
        Characters Who Would Maker Great Demon Slayers Taking into account the
        incredibly heavy toll Super Saiyan 3 puts on a living body — and how
        much effort Goku puts into transforming while dead — it's no wonder the
        form takes Goku significant time to master. He’s since gotten a firm
        hold of Super Saiyan 3 in Dragon Ball Super, but its depiction in the
        Buu arc proves too unwieldy for Goku.

        Super Saiyan 4 Goku standing in front of Planet Earth in the Dragon Ball
        GT Opening The Super Saiyan 4 transformation gained immense popularity
        when it debuted in Dragon Ball GT. While this Goku form, and the series
        it debuted in, were eventually made non-canon, it still made frequent
        appearances in video games and merchandise. After being defeated by Baby
        as a Super Saiyan 3, Goku pursued a greater power. Goku obtained Super
        Saiyan 4 by first regaining his Saiyan tail with help from Old Kai,
        Sugoro, and Shusugoro. This allowed Goku to transform into a Golden
        Oozaru. Goku initially had little control over this form. When Pan got
        through to him, Goku gained control of his Golden Oozaru form. In doing
        so, Goku completed his ascent to Super Saiyan 4, which included a
        grown-up body.

        Super Saiyan God Goku Dodge from Dragon Ball FighterZ prepares to
        strike. At its core, Battle of Gods is a character study of Son Goku and
        the themes that define Dragon Ball. The story centers itself on an
        unbeatable foe, forcing Goku past his limits but without giving him the
        actual satisfaction of doing so. Battle of Gods humbles Goku, especially
        through the act of the Super Saiyan God ritual. Super Saiyan God isn't a
        form Goku earns on his own accord — he receives it through the power of
        others. It’s not something he wants, but he understands it’s needed. At
        the same time, Beerus recognizes Goku’s skill remains his own even if
        his power isn’t. There’s a lot to analyze about Goku’s characterization
        in BoG.

        Gods, Vegeta and Goku train with Whis. The anime and manga never reveal
        how either martial artist triggers Super Saiyan Blue, but everything
        indicates they master Super Saiyan Blue during this training period. As
        Whis is training them in the art of God Ki, it’s likely SSB remains one

        Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken Goku punches hit in Dragon Ball Super After
        Golden Frieza's defeat, both Goku and Vegeta sought to improve upon
        their newfound Super Saiyan Blue abilities. Vegeta accomplished this
        later on in Dragon Ball Super, but Goku quickly found a new avenue
        through the use of an old technique. Thanks to having greater ki control
        through Super Saiyan Blue, Goku could incorporate the Kaioken technique.
        Goku initially planned to save this form for a rematch against Beerus,
        but felt needed to use its ability multipliers to get past Hit's
        time-skip technique. Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken had the same drawbacks as
        the base Kaioken, as Goku's body couldn't handle it indefinitely.

        Ultra Instinct Goku versus Jiren in Dragon Ball Super The Universe
        Survival arc became a major turning point for Dragon Ball Super and
        basically re-contextualized modern Dragon Ball. All the pieces had been
        rearranged, the multiverse has been properly expanded, and Goku had a
        new end goal in mind: mastering Ultra Instinct. Goku triggered Ultra
        Instinct for the first time during the Tournament of Power. In the
        anime, Ultra Instinct was fueled by his own Genki Dama’s energy, whereas
        the manga had Goku tapping into Ultra Instinct as a mental state. Ultra
        Instinct was treated like a technique through the series’ actual text,
        but it’s depicted as a transformation. As of the Moro arc, Goku could
        trigger Ultra Instinct -Sign- at will so long as his mind was calm.

        Completed Mastered Ultra Instinct Goku in Dragon Ball Super. Ultra
        Instinct -Sign- wasn't enough to surpass Jiren in the Tournament of
        Power — Goku needed to dig deeper by completing his Ultra Instinct form.
        Pushed to the brink of elimination in his Ultra Instinct -Sign- form,
        Goku remained on the defensive during an onslaught of Jiren punches.
        After a while, Goku pushed back. This surge in offense culminated in
        Goku reaching the Perfected Ultra Instinct. It wasn't until training
        with Merus during the Moro arc that he reached Ultra Instinct -Sign-
        again. Goku later triggered the completed Ultra Instinct after Merus'
        erasure, when Goku kept his emotions in check during a heartbreaking
        moment. Since then, Goku has used the form at will.

        Goku's Divine Ki Giant Battle Avatar as seen in Dragon Ball Super During
        the Galactic Patrol Prisoner arc, Goku is pushed to his absolute limits
        against Planet-Eater Moro. In order to stop the warlock from detonating
        and destroying the galaxy, Goku attempts to destroy the villain's
        forehead crystal, only to be captured and drained of energy by his
        opponent. However, thanks to the divine energy of Uub and Goku's other
        allies, the series' protagonist could recharge and reach a new form:
        Divine Ki Giant Battle Avatar. RELATED: 7 Ways Black Hair Is Perfect For
        Goku's Strongest Form This form — which is visually similar to the
        Susanoo seen in the Narutofranchise — is a physical manifestation of
        Goku's Divine ki. So far, the transformation has only occurred while
        Goku was in dire circumstances against Moro and Gas, the primary
        antagonists of the manga's latest arcs.

        True Ultra Instinct Goku kicking Gas in the Dragon Ball Super Manga For
        Goku to utilize Perfected Ultra Instinct, his emotions must be
        completely calm. While this transformation increases his power
        immensely, it doesn't lean into Goku's natural disposition. The Saiyan
        warrior is driven by passion, ambition, and rage when he fights, and as
        a result, Perfect Ultra Instinct isn't maximizing his talents. However,
        True Ultra Instinct, which Goku achieves by combining Ultra Instinct
        -Sign- with his Saiyan emotions, perfectly suits his battle-driven
        nature. Goku and Vegeta struggled to defend themselves against Gas
        during the Granolah the Survivor arc until the former debuted this form.
        Using its newfound power, he gained the upper hand against Gas, even
        after the villain survived Granolah's ultimate attack. Were it not for
        the intervention of Black Frieza, True Ultra Instinct would easily be
        the strongest form to appear in the franchise.
